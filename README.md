# BPN_data_management

This repository contains a guideline and collection of resources for management of data and scripts.  

Our workflow deals with multimodal data sets and complex analysis methods, which makes it prone to clutter and chaos.   
By taking a moment to think about how to structure the project efficiently,  
you can save your own time in the long run, save digital storage space,  
and enable other researchers to benefit from your outputs even when you are no longer working on the project.

Implementing good practices in data and script management is not only a matter of practicality,  
but also an ethical action respecting the resources that go into our research.  

At all stages of project development, we should keep this question in mind :  
When a fellow neuroscientist sets their eyes on the project for the first time, how easily can they navigate through the structure and reproduce the workflow?  

## Please throw a look at this repository

## Step-by-step guide
### For setting up a project
1. Set up a project folder in BPN Projects (P:) drive by creating a folder named "**Project_(your project name)**".
   	You can also copy the [template project folder](https://github.com/BeMoBIL/BPN_data_management/tree/main/template_project_folder) to start with a predifined structure.

2. Please make sure you choose a name that can be intuitively understood.   
	For instance, use "**Project_Virtual_Watermaze**" instead of "**Project_vWM**".

 	It also has to be somewhat specific to the project.  
	For example, use a name like "**Project_Hexa_Navigation**" and avoid using an overly generic name such as "**Project_Navigation**".

3. Drop a [README file](https://github.com/BeMoBIL/BPN_data_management/blob/main/template_project_folder/Project_Watermaze-ERD/README.md) into the folder.    
	Fill out all details at hand and update them on a regular basis as you populate the contents of your folder.  	

### For managing data sets
1. We keep at least two copies of data - []

### For managing analysis scripts   
1. We strongly recommend the use of version control system such as git. 

### For archiving a project
1. Please make sure that archived data sets have no redundancy.
